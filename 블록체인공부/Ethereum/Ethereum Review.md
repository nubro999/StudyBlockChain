# Ethereum Knowledge Base Summary

This folder contains a comprehensive set of notes on the Ethereum blockchain, covering its fundamental concepts, technical components, and ecosystem. Here's a breakdown of the key topics:

**Core Concepts:**

*   **What is Ethereum:** An introduction to Ethereum as a programmable blockchain, its history, and its core features like smart contracts and DApps.
*   **What is EVM:** Explains the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the runtime environment for smart contracts, its Turing-complete nature, and the concept of Gas.
*   **SmartContract:** A detailed explanation of smart contracts, their self-executing and immutable nature, and their wide range of applications in DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.
*   **Transaction:** Describes the structure of an Ethereum transaction, including fields like `from`, `to`, `value`, `gasLimit`, and the process of signing transactions with a private key.
*   **Gas:** Explains the concept of Gas as the computational fee for executing transactions and smart contracts on the EVM.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** Discusses how Ethereum achieves consensus, moving from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
*   **PoS (Proof-of-Stake):** Details the PoS consensus mechanism, the role of validators, and the structure of slots and epochs.
*   **Beacon Chain:** Explains the role of the Beacon Chain as the consensus layer in Ethereum's PoS architecture.

**Technical Components & Standards:**

*   **KEY:** Explains the process of generating private keys, public keys, and wallet addresses using cryptographic methods like ECDSA and Keccak-256.
*   **RLP Encoding:** Describes the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding standard used to serialize data structures like transactions and blocks in Ethereum.
*   **Data field:** A note linking to the official documentation about the `data` field in Ethereum transactions.
*   **TuringComplete:** A brief explanation of the concept of Turing completeness and its relevance to the EVM.
*   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Explains how this decentralized storage system is used in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly for storing NFT metadata and DApp frontends.

**Ecosystem & Tools:**

*   **Dapp (Decentralized Application):** A detailed report on DApps, their architecture, benefits, limitations, and key platforms like Ethereum, EOS, and TRON.
*   **DEX (Decentralized Exchange):** Explains what DEXs are, how they work (often using AMMs), and compares them to centralized exchanges.
*   **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):** Touches upon DAOs and the infamous "DAO Hack" incident, which led to the hard fork creating Ethereum Classic.
*   **Meta Mask:** Explains how the MetaMask wallet works as a bridge between users and DApps, managing private keys and signing transactions.
*   **Ganache, HardHat, Truffle:** Notes on popular development tools for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Ethereum.
*   **Sepolia:** Describes the Sepolia testnet, a crucial environment for developers to test their applications before deploying to the mainnet.
*   **Consensus Client:** Explains the role of consensus clients (like Prysm, Lighthouse) in the post-Merge era, working alongside execution clients (like Geth) to run a full Ethereum node.

**Security & Advanced Topics:**

*   **DAO해킹사건 (DAO Hack Incident):** A detailed account of the 2016 DAO hack, its consequences, and the resulting hard fork that created Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).
*   **영지식증명 (Zero-Knowledge Proofs):** A note linking to information about zk-SNARKs, an advanced cryptographic technique for privacy and scaling.

In summary, this folder is a well-structured knowledge base for anyone looking to understand Ethereum from the ground up, covering everything from the basic principles to the practical tools and advanced concepts that define the ecosystem.
